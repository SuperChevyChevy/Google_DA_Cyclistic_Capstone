Google Data Analytics Capstone Project for "Cyclistic"
This is my case study for a Google Data Abalytics capstone project.

The bike share company "Cyclistic" wants to convert their daily and single ride users into "Members", annuual subscribers. As a junior data analyst on their marketing team, I've been tasked with analyzing the data and creating a presentation to executives that communicates my findings and offers recommendation.

I've included a written report and Powerpoint presentation. A video presentation will come soon and the written report and presentation will likely need to be updated.
